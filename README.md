<h1 align="center">Recall</h1>

Recall is a modern revision app, focussed on revolutionizing the way you revise topics. Every topic you learn is recorded as atomic objects with its own rating and last revised date. Then, the home page uses an algorithm to analyze which topics require more importance and then, sorts the list and breaks it into 3 - Now, Next and Later.
